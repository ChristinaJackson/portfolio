          <h2>The Why:</h2>
          <p>
              I coordinated this project because I wanted to gain experience developing collaboratively. I reached out to someone who
              I thought would be willing to participate and together we decided that we would build a mock store front page. I built the image grid,
              developed the high contrast mode for color accessibility, applied flex-box layout features to the header and footer as well as footer design. My partner 
              implemented and adapted code for the cart from a tutorial and from there I added the filter on the products page as well as the feature to click out of cart area to close cart.

          <h2>Challenges and things to improve:</h2>
          <p>The biggest challenge here was also the most fun part of this project. My partner on this project lives in a time zone 10 hours ahead of mine so one of us was working on the 
              project at all times, which made it go quickly but coordination of tasks was difficult at first. We then used trello to track tasks that needed to be done and grabbed what 
              we wanted to work on that day from the board. Eventually I would like to go in and improve the positioning and the color accessibility button styling.
